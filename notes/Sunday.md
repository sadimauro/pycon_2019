Guido ~ Ricky
"Controversial PEPs left and right"..."it's time for someone else, another structure".
Like when your kid goes to college.  You never stop worrying...that's why I nominated myself for the Steering Group.

Steering committee identifies/delegates to a core dev or outsider to be the ultimate decider.  They delegate like this whenever they can.
