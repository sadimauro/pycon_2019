General Impressions of the Conferences
======================================

Lots on diversity, accessibility and inclusion.  Gender-neutral bathrooms, mothers' rooms, quiet room, trained incident responders, pac-man rule, hallway track, etc.  More on [this site](https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/code-of-conduct/).

Lots on pushing for better treatment of Python developers.  "We need sponsors and donors", "volunteering on weekends can't be the way we push Python forward", "Python needs an R&D division".  Dealing with the open-source community, esp folks that feel entitled to FOSS, is very draining.  Leads to burnout, mental health issues.



Useful tidbits
==============

(Only from talks I attended.  See other talks too!)

Decorators are neat.  See examples in decorators.py.  Also see dclasses.py for the `@dataclasses.dataclass` decorator.
